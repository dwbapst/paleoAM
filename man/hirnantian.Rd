\title{Katian-Hirnantian Graptolite Assemblages Reported by Sheets et al. (2016)}
\format{
This dataset is composed of two objects: 

\describe{
\item{graptCommData}{A data table of sample IDs and
 relative species abundances.}

\item{graptSampleInfo}{A data table of additional locality and geologic age
 information related to each sample.}}

\description{
This is a data set of relative abundances for planktonic graptolite species 
from two sections that cross the Katian-Hirnantian boundary in the late Paleozoic.
}
\details{
This data set contains the relative abundances 
(proportion of specimens identified)
for 43 species of planktonic graptolites, 
across 34 samples taken from two outcrops: 
(a) a section at Vininni Creek in Nevada, USA, and 
(b) a second section at Blackstone River in the Yukon, Canada. 
Both of these sections cross the Katian-Hirnantian boundary and the
relative abundances reported here were provided as supplementary material
with Sheets et al. (2016).
