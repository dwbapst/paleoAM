Description: Tools for modeling abundance distributions over environmental
     gradients, and tools for simulating those communities over various 
     sedimentary histories. For use with fossil records with detailed age
     models and abundance distributions used for calculating environmental
     gradients from ordinations or other indices based on fossil assemblages.
