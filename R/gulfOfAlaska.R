#' Benthic Foram Abundances from the Gulf of Alaska Reported by Sharon et al. 2021
#' 
#' Loads the foraminifera abundances collected and published by Sharon et al. (2021),
#'  as used in the simulation analyses published in Belanger and Bapst (2023).

#' @details 
#' This data set contains the absolute abundances (number of specimens identified)
#' for 48 species of benthic foraminifera, across 355 samples, taken from Sharon 
#' et al (2021). These samples were collected from the less than 63 Î¼m size fractions
#' taken from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 341 Site U141 and the 
#' co-located jumbo piston core, respectively located at 697 meters and 682 meters
#'  water depth in the Gulf of Alaska (Jaeger et al., 2014).
